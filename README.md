# password-generator

## Description
    This activity was my first attempt at using Javascript. This page should generate a password based on input from the user to determine length and what sort of characters are included in the password. The length range is from 8-128 characters and the character options are lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. I used arrays to outline the options and created an array of arrays to select the password content.
